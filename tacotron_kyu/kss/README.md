# KSS Dataset: Korean Single speaker Speech Dataset

KSS Dataset is designed for the Korean text-to-speech task. It consists of audio files recorded by a professional female voice actoress and their aligned text extracted from my books. As a copyright holder, by courtesy of the publishers, I release this dataset to the public. To my best knowledge,  this is the first publicly available speech dataset for Korean.

## File Format
Each line in `transcript.txt` is delimited by | into four fields.
